# GitHub API Integration Module
This script allows users to communicate with the GitHub API and retrieve information. It is a handy tool for accessing GitHub data using a Personal Access Token (PAT) and a GitHub API REST endpoint.

To obtain a GitHub token and a GitHub API REST endpoint, follow these steps:

### 1. GitHub Token:

1. **Create a GitHub Account (if you don't have one)**:
   If you don't have a GitHub account, go to [GitHub's website](https://github.com) and create an account.

2. **Sign In to GitHub**:
   Sign in to your GitHub account.

3. **Go to Settings**:
   Click on your profile picture in the top right corner and select "Settings."

4. **Access Developer Settings**:
   In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings."

5. **Generate a New Personal Access Token**:
   - Click on "Personal access tokens."
   - Click "Generate new token."
   - Enter a token description and select the scopes (permissions) that you need for your use case (e.g., repo, read:user, user:email).
   - Click "Generate token."

   **Important**: Save this token in a secure location. Once you leave or refresh the page, you won't be able to see it again.

6. **Use the Generated Token**:
   This generated token will be used as your GitHub token in the script.

### 2. GitHub API REST Endpoint:

GitHub REST API endpoints define the resources and actions you want to perform on GitHub. For example, to get information about a repository, the endpoint might be `/repos/username/repo`.

You can find the appropriate GitHub REST API endpoints and their documentation in the [GitHub API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).

For your script, replace `[REST_expression]` with the desired GitHub API REST endpoint (e.g., `/repos/username/repo`). Make sure to read the GitHub API documentation to understand the available endpoints and how to use them according to your requirements.

Now, with the GitHub token and a specific GitHub API REST endpoint in hand, you can use them as parameters when running your script.

To run the given Bash script in Git Bash, follow these steps:

1. **Open Git Bash**: Launch Git Bash on your computer.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where the script is located. For example, if the script is in a folder called "scripts" on your desktop, you would use:

   ```bash
   cd Desktop/scripts
   ```

3. **Edit the Script (Optional)**: If needed, you can open the script in a text editor and make any necessary modifications.

4. **Make the Script Executable**: Use the `chmod` command to make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x script_name.sh
   ```

   Replace `script_name.sh` with the actual name of your script.

5. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using `./script_name.sh`:

   ```bash
   ./script_name.sh [your_github_token] [REST_expression]
   ```

   Replace `[your_github_token]` with your GitHub token and `[REST_expression]` with the desired REST expression.

   For example:

   ```bash
   ./script_name.sh your_actual_token "/repos/username/repo"
   ```

   Replace `your_actual_token` and `/repos/username/repo` with appropriate values.

The script will run and retrieve information from GitHub based on the provided GitHub token and REST expression.
